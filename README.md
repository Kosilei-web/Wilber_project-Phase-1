Aviation Incident Analysis: 

Overview
This project aims to analyze aviation incident data to uncover trends, identify factors contributing to accidents, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance aviation safety. Key methods employed in the analysis include:

Descriptive Statistics
Data Visualizations
Data-driven Insights
The goal is to extract meaningful patterns from the data and use them to inform decision-making processes in the aviation industry.

Business Understanding

Business Problem
The company is entering the aviation market by purchasing and operating aircraft for both commercial and private enterprises. With the potential risks associated with various aircraft types, the company seeks to make informed decisions regarding aircraft purchases. The task is to identify low-risk aircraft that will help minimize potential safety hazards.

Objectives
Assess Risk Factors: Analyze historical aviation data to evaluate risks associated with various aircraft types.
Identify Trends and Patterns: Examine incidents related to aircraft type, manufacturer, and usage.
Provide Recommendations: Offer recommendations on the safest aircraft for purchase based on data insights.

Key Questions
What are the trends in accidents across different phases of flight?
How has the frequency of aviation accidents changed over time?
Which locations and weather conditions are most associated with aviation accidents?
What are the most common causes of aviation incidents?
How does aircraft damage impact fatality counts?

Key Stakeholders

Aviation Regulatory Authorities
Aircraft Manufacturers
Airlines and Aviation Operators
Aircraft Maintenance Providers
Insurance Companies
Pilots, Flight Crew & Passengers

Key Deliverables
A comprehensive analysis of aviation incident data.
Risk assessments for various aircraft types and manufacturers.
Actionable safety recommendations based on data-driven insights.
Data Understanding and Analysis

Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis comes from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It contains civil aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023, covering incidents in the United States and international waters.

Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into the frequency and severity of aviation incidents. By identifying trends, aircraft types, and manufacturers associated with higher accident rates, the company can make data-driven decisions when selecting aircraft for purchase, ultimately enhancing safety and reducing risks in its aviation operations.

Recommendations
Focus on purchasing aircraft from manufacturers with lower accident frequencies.
Invest in comprehensive training for pilots, especially regarding adverse weather conditions and flight phases with high incident rates.
Implement regular safety audits on aircraft categories associated with higher fatality rates.
This project offers actionable insights that support the companyâ€™s goal of ensuring safety in its aviation operations and making informed purchasing decisions
